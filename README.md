# Adaline vs Perceptron: Classification Model Comparison

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a comparative analysis between **Adaline (SGDClassifier)** and **Perceptron** algorithms on a classification task. It includes data preprocessing, model training, decision boundary visualization, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, a closed-form solution for linear regression is computed for reference.

Key aspects include:
- StandardScaler preprocessing
- Adaline using SGDClassifier
- Perceptron training and decision boundary plots
- Accuracy and classification reports
- Analytic solution via Normal Equation

## 📊 Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## 📁 Project File
```
AdlineVsPerceptron.py     → Full implementation: data loading, model training, evaluation, and visualization
```

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```
